# Diwali Sales Analysis using Python and Pandas
I worked on a practical project focusing on a Diwali sales dataset. This project taught me how to
use Python and Pandas for data analysis.

The objective of this project is: 
1. Improve customer experienece by analyzing data
2. Increase revenue

By scrutinizing the dataset, I endeavored to uncover patterns, preferences, and trends that would
lead to an improved understanding of customer behavior. This, in turn, would aid in tailoring
strategies to heighten customer satisfaction and optimize revenue generation. Through this practical
exercise, I honed my data analysis skills while simultaneously contributing to the goals of enhancing
customer engagement and driving financial success.
